## 1. Problem Statement

How can participant demographics, experience, and engagement levels help understand and predict graduation outcomes in the Everything Data mentorship cohort?

## 2. Why Do I Want to Solve This Problem?

Understanding what drives success in the mentorship program can help improve future cohorts by tailoring support, refining selection criteria, and optimizing learning paths for different types of learners.

## 3. Who Will Benefit When This Problem Is Solved?

1) Program organizers: They’ll gain insights to improve structure and support.
2) Future participants: They’ll benefit from a more personalized and effective learning experience.
3) Mentors: They’ll understand how to better guide mentees based on their background and goals.
   
## 4. Project Goals
Analyze, transform, and draw insights from the dataset to:
1) Understand participant demographics, motivations, and performance.  
2) Highlight factors that influence graduation rates. 
3) Present actionable recommendations for improving future cohorts.

## 5. Brief Description of the Process I’ll Follow

### Step 1: Understand the Data
1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Check for missing values, data types, and basic statistics.

### Step 2: Clean and Prepare the Data
1. Handle missing or inconsistent entries.
2. Convert categorical data into usable formats (e.g., encoding gender, country).
3. Normalize or scale numerical data if needed.
   
### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Visualize demographics (age, gender, country).
2. Explore relationships (e.g., hours per week vs. score).
3. Compare graduation rates across tracks and experience levels.
   
### Step 4: Feature Engineering
1. Create new variables that might help in prediction (e.g., engagement score).
2. Group or bin variables (e.g., age ranges into categories).

### Step 5: Modeling Strategy
1. Choose a simple model: Logistic regression and  decision tree/ random forest.
2. Train the model to predict graduation status.

### Step 6 Evaluate performance using metrics: 
1. Accuracy 
2. Precision
3. Recall
4. F1- score
   
### Step 7: Insights and Recommendations
1. Summarize key findings.
2. Suggest improvements for future cohorts.
3. Highlight what factors most influence graduation.
